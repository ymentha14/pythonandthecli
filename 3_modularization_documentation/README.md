## 3. Modularity

This section is pretty straightforward: it aims at proviging you with an equivalent version of the previous notebook that brings modularity and tried to follow the principles of __single responsabily__ and __spearation of concerns__

Ideally, a good main should be understandable at a high level just by reading the function names. Additionally, docstrings and type hints will make our functions more readable so that the reader can seamlessly deep dive in the code.

There is a catch: what if we want to use these functions in other notebooks/scripts? That is the topic of the next section!
